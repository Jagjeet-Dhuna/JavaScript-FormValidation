## Features

- Validates the form inputs in real-time as the user interacts with the form.
- Provides immediate feedback to the user by highlighting invalid fields and displaying error messages.
- Implements validation rules for different types of fields, including required fields, email format, password strength, and checkbox selection.
- Utilizes JavaScript to handle form submission, preventing it if any of the fields are invalid.
- Separates the presentation logic from the validation logic by using CSS to style the form and error messages.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Fill in the form fields and observe the validation in action.
4. Try submitting the form with invalid input to see the error messages.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the form structure and input fields.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that defines the styles for the form and error messages.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file responsible for implementing the form validation logic.
